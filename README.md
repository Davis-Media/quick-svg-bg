## Quick SVG Background

_by Davis_

Quickly add a background to your SVGs.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server

## Deploying

This is using Cloudflare to deploy, if you just run the deploy command it will deploy to Cloudflare, but will break because you don't have my domain. Switch that out for your own domain and it will work.

`pnpm run deploy`
